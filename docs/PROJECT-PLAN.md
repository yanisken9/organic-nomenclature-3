# MuLERMoCs — Project Plan
## Multiple-Level External Representations for Molecular Concepts
### Organic Chemistry Interactive Learning & Research Platform

**Principal Investigator:** N. Charistos, Department of Chemistry, ΑΠΘ
**Status:** Active development | v52 live (136 molecules — 136 `nameExamples` keys): unified rich note editor (inline WYSIWYG, modal WYSIWYG + HTML source, lazy legacy-text upgrade, staged Apply/Cancel and dirty-close confirm); safe rich HTML notes (DOMPurify), rule-table components, a compact icon toolbar, and a Snap-free native `MuSVG` 2D overlay; the v51 rich notes, v50 presentation rails/persistent naming shell, and the v49 MSc-student `thesis-work` import are retained; the 2026-10-26 thesis-work port adds 28 molecules (126 total), ketone/aldehyde/ether graph guards, methanal handling, sequential ketone numbering, and ether naming/highlight fixes; the 2026-10-28 acid extension adds 10 carboxylic acids (136 total) with acid graph guards and sequential acid numbering. Default scenario: `Αλκάνια-Αιθάνιο-τεστ`. `index.html` → v52, v51/v50/v49/v48/v47/v46/v45/v44 runnable at root, v43 frozen at tag `v43`, v42 frozen in repo2. Automated Chrome/Firefox matrices pass; `MuSVG.parse()` OOM/XML crash fixed. The two pre-existing skeletal JSmol failures and some manual coverage remain open.
**Last updated:** 2026-10-26

> **2026-10 update:** vision is now twofold+1 (community tool + research publications + platform for isomerism/reactions) with four layers in LEARN-first order — LEARN → EXPLORE-lite → PRACTICE → PLAY. The static chemistry app is embedded in Drupal; logging is research-primary. Source of truth for layers: `docs/LAYERS-PLAN.md`. Team P1–P6 roles and timeline are defined there and in `README.md`. What follows below is the original plan text, kept for theory and history; version/count claims predating v44 are superseded.

## Vision

Build a theoretically grounded, research-instrumented interactive platform for organic chemistry learning — covering nomenclature, isomerism, and reactions — that serves both Greek chemistry students and the international chemistry education research community.

The platform generates Greek IUPAC names algorithmically, displays molecules in multiple representations (2D condensed, expanded, annotated skeletal, skeletal, 3D), and supports interactive quiz scenarios designed for both learning and research data collection.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Algorithmic IUPAC naming | No | No | No | Yes |
| Multiple 2D representation modes | No | No | No | Yes |
| Synchronized 2D + 3D highlighting | No | No | No | Yes |
| Greek language | No | No | No (EN/FR) | Yes |
| Research instrumentation (logging, condition lock) | No | No | No | Phased (schema v1 in `docs/LAYERS-PLAN.md`) |
| Quiz interaction scenarios | No | No | Yes | Phased (PRACTICE 3 types v1 → PLAY) |
| Quantum-accurate IRC trajectories (reactions) | No | Partial | No | Planned |

## Theoretical Framework

**CTML** (Mayer, 2009) — Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning
- Guides when multiple representations help vs. hurt learning
- Spatial contiguity principle → synchronized highlighting design

**DeFT** (Ainsworth, 1999, 2006) — Design, Functions, Tasks framework
- Three functions of multiple representations: complementary, constraining, constructive
- Constraining function → the representation fading sequence (core original contribution)

**The Representation Fading Sequence** *(original design principle)*
```
Condensed → Expanded → Annotated Skeletal → Pure Skeletal → 3D
CH₃CH₂OH    (explicit H)   (C visible on         (C implicit)    (spatial
(textbook)               zig-zag geometry)                       geometry)
```
Each step removes one scaffolding layer. Familiar representations constrain interpretation of unfamiliar ones. **Not previously proposed or tested in chemistry education literature.**

## Module 1: Organic Nomenclature — Current State (v52 live; v37 text below kept for history)

### What exists
- **136 molecules** (136 `nameExamples` keys: the previous 98 plus 9 ketones/diones/ynones, 12 aldehydes/dials, 7 monoethers and 10 carboxylic acids) covering homologous-series menu groups (series-first, rules secondary)
- **v51 data (retained)** — adds 18 molecules (9 alcohols, 6 dienes, 3 enynes), 54 embedded 2D forms and 18 runtime 3D SDFs, with bounded acyclic-alcohol branch naming; the existing 80 entries are unchanged. Branch prefixes are still limited to pure acyclic hydrocarbons/alcohols; other series need the generic branch/FG-profile refactor.
- **Algorithmic IUPAC engine** — DFS main chain determination, 3-tier locant rules, Greek euphony; ester two-word naming + ether systematic/common toggle since v40/v41
- **5 representation modes** — condensed, expanded, annotated skeletal (partial), skeletal, 3D
- **Synchronized highlighting** — same atom/bond highlighted simultaneously in 2D and 3D
- **Teaching layer** — rule-based explanations, component name boxes, TTS narration in Greek
- **Didactic scenarios (current `-52`; scaffold since v43)** — additive `js/mulermoc-nom-scenario-52.js`: snapshot capture/validate/apply/export/import, `?scenario=&present=#step=` playback, exit restores full chrome; default preload is `scenarios/Αλκάνια-Αιθάνιο-τεστ.scenario.json`. v52 adds the unified rich note editor (inline WYSIWYG, modal WYSIWYG + HTML source, lazy legacy-text upgrade, staged Apply/Cancel, dirty-close confirm); the same-day refinement adds UL/OL lists, per-block font size/alignment, an image sizing dialog, a presentation top card that spans the visible app columns (capped at 1600px), and a stretch side rail, and removes the URL image tool. UL/OL remain in the inline toolbar; image, table, and predefined-content inserts are modal-only. It retains the v51 rich HTML notes, rule-table components, compact icon toolbar, v50 per-step text position (top/left/right rail), and persistent naming shell.
- **Main-chain stepper (v47, done)** — FG-aware multiple-bond-first pool (max `C=C/C≡C` → max `C=C` → length) with settings-panel `‹ n/N ›` stepper, rank-parallel 2D+3D
- **Fluid viewers + authoring pin-dock (v48, retained through v52)** — 2D/3D viewers fit their container (native `setSize`, container-derived heights); the scenario bar pins full-height beside the app (scoped horizontal scroll with cues) so name settings stay reachable while authoring; plus per-viewer single max-height and combined double-viewer height controls and a settings-panel UI pass (toggles consolidated, main-chain `Από δεδομένα` disabled without stored data)
- **Student import (v49, retained in v52)** — acyclic-alkane parent-chain ranking (most carbon branches → lowest branch locants) with explicit terminal unsaturation locant (`3-μεθυλο-1-βουτένιο`); 73rd molecule `ethyl_3_dimethyl_2_5_hexane` + 3D SDF; stored chains for the alkene test molecules; alkene scenarios (`Αλκένια-Αιθένιο`, `Αλκένια-Ονοματολογία_και_διακλαδώσεις`); alkyl reference table for locants/branches and enyne `-ιν-` rule-table fix
- **Presentation polish (v52 live, added in v50)** — per-step text placement top/left/right as a fourth-column sticky rail, plus a persistent naming title/gear shell with a no-molecule placeholder and a zero-visible-box explain-line guard
- **Technical validation** — algorithm verified against the curated set; tertiary-amine R3N classification fixed in v44 via the bond-order N-table; multi-substituent alkane naming (`2,3-διμεθυλοβουτάνιο`) fixed in v45 (browser verification pending)

### Known gaps to fill (immediate work)
- Annotated skeletal representation: `fMakeAnnotatedSkeletal()` — completes the fading sequence
- Atom click targets: `fAddAtomClickTargets()` — enables PRACTICE/PLAY exercises (deferred to Phase 3 per `docs/LAYERS-PLAN.md`)
- Branched molecule naming (alkyl substituents) — v52 covers pure acyclic hydrocarbons/alcohols, acyclic aldehydes/ketones and saturated monoethers (including C4 iso-/sec-/tert- shapes); generalizing branch detection, principal-group locant ranking, and prefix ordering to acids/amines/halides and mixed FGs remains open
- Ether naming — saturated acyclic mono-ethers extended through v52 (systematic + common, branched propyl/butyl/isopropyl/isobutyl/sec-butyl/tert-butyl examples); remaining: unsaturated ether chains
- Ester naming — detection/naming/highlight done since v41 (`ethanoic_methyl_ester`, `propanoic_methyl_ester`); remaining: wider coverage, unsaturated chains

 Representations for Molecular Concepts
