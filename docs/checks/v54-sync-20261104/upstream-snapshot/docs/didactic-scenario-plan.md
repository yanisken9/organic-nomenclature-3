# Didactic Scenarios — plan

Brief proposal for teacher-authored, linear snapshot sequences
for classroom presentation and student self-learning.

## 1. Goal / non-goals

Goal: let an author save the current SPA state as a snapshot,
collect several snapshots, and play them as a numbered linear
sequence of steps.

* Presentation hides the left menu; naming and rule panels are
  optional per step.
* v1 persistence is a hand-editable JSON text file (export /
  import, reusable). No backend in v1.
* Future: Drupal-hosted scenarios with logged-teacher authoring
  (see `PROJECT-PLAN.md` Phase 3). v1 reserves fields but does
  not implement it.

Non-goals for v1: branching scenarios, quiz scoring, student
progress tracking, server storage.
(Removed 2026-10-06: PubChem/external-links placeholders — not in this phase.)

## 2. Snapshot schema (v1 JSON)

> **Note:** the file below is one scenario card.
> The author bar holds multiple cards (`scenarios[]`, explicit active card,
> per-card Save/Steps/Export/Play); Export writes one card per file in this
> shape. Working-copy field notes: there is no Menu checkbox (menu is derived
> from picks), no `Text` checkbox (heading + text show automatically iff the
> step carries title or note — legacy `show.text` is ignored/self-healing),
> and `styleHighlight` is additive (`bondAtoms`, `numberingAtoms`).
> `menuGroups` is additive (`molecules` default = flat list, `chemclass` /
> `series` classify the picked subset; unknown values coerce out, missing or
> empty falls back to flat — no version bump). `styleText` is additive
> (`fontSizePx` 12–28/null is the legacy whole-note base, `textWidthPx`
> 320–1200/null is still parsed but ignored by v52, `columns` 1|2/null,
> `position` `"left"`/`"right"`/null (v50); null = theme defaults). Per-block
> font size/alignment live in the note HTML as allowlisted `note-fs-*` /
> `note-align-*` classes. `styleName.hidden` + `show.nameEye` carry
> per-component visibility (see §2 visibility rules).

State notes (grounded in v52; v42–v51 identical unless noted):

* `author` (v52, additive, no version bump) is optional free text on the
  scenario card: blank/whitespace-only/absent → `"Unknown"` (trimmed, capped at
  120 chars). `created` (v52, additive) is the ISO timestamp stamped when the
  card is created (`+ New`/Import/deep-link preload); import keeps the file's
  value when it parses. Both are edited in the card's `Author:` row and always
  written by Export. Legacy files without either field load as
  `author: "Unknown"` + the card's creation time; a non-string author or an
  unparseable date is dropped with an import warning. Presentation ignores both
  (metadata only).
* `selectedMol`, `mode2D/modeSuffix`, `mainChainMode`,
  `etherNamingMode`, `nameAnalysisMode`, `selectedRule` mirror
  `js/mulermoc-nom-molview-51.js` (`fSelectMol`, `fShowNameAnalysis`,
  `fExplainNameComp`). (Older revisions cited `molview-42.js` line numbers;
  line refs are fragile — prefer function names.)
* `mode2D` ∈ `condensed` / `expanded` / `skeletal` / `condensedZigZag`;
  `modeSuffix` ∈ `"_2D_Condensed"` / `"_2D_Expanded"` / `"_2D_Skeletal"`;
  stored chain keys `mainChain_Condensed` / `mainChain_Expanded` /
  `mainChain_Skeletal` (pre-v45 names `diagramatic`, `""`/`"_E"`/`"_diagr2D"`,
  `mainChain[_E|_diagr]`). Legacy files carrying `mode2D: "diagramatic"`
  coerce to `skeletal` on import with a warning (in-memory migration, no
  version bump).
* `chainIdx` (v47, additive, no version bump): main-chain walk index into the
  molecule's multiple-bond-first main-chain pool (0 = adopted main chain). Captured silently
  from live state on Save (menu-only steps store 0); re-asserted after the
  step load (naming/boxes stay winner-based, highlight replay paints the
  stored chain; 3D follows via the shared index when its parse lands).
  Absent/invalid → 0 with an import warning when a value was present;
  out-of-range for the molecule falls back to 0 at apply. Never covers
  menu-only steps; Exit keeps the exit step's chain (no author-chain stash,
  same contract as `selectedMol`).
* `mainChainMode` ∈ `data` / `algorithmic` (default `algorithmic`). The
  `Από δεδομένα` bullet in Ρυθμίσεις is disabled (and `mainChainMode` falls
  back to `algorithmic`) when the selected molecule has no stored chain for
  the current representation — a missing key **or** an empty array (the eight
  ether/ester molecules and two branched-alkane placeholders store
  `mainChain_*: []`) — and also when no molecule is selected (v48).
  `fUpdateChainModeButton()` owns the state; `fScenarioSyncControlUi()`
  re-syncs it on apply/exit, so a step saved with `mainChainMode: "data"` on a
  no-data molecule plays back algorithmically.
* 2D style: `svgAtomColors2DFlag`, `atomColorMode2D`,
  `zigzagCheck` are stored; menu grouping mode is not (menu is
  hidden in playback). The legacy original-JSME pane toggle is not
  stored either.
* Highlight options: `styleHighlight` stores the DOM-class-only checkboxes
  `bondAtomsCheck` (bond-component atom highlight, default off),
  `highlightNumberingCheck` (default on) and `highlightNumberingBondsCheck`
  (C–C bonds during numbering, default on); apply restores the classes before
  `fSelectMol` since highlight readers query them live; legacy files without
  the group get defaults (additive, no version bump). Present entry stashes
  the author's live states; Exit restores them (not the step's values).
  Apply also re-syncs the `Έγχρωμα Σύμβολα` checkbox and atom/group radios
  from `style2D` (the SVG class already re-syncs from the flag in
  `fUpdateSVG`; `fSyncAtomColorModeDisabled()` dims the atom/group radios
  when the coloring checkbox is off); Exit force-restores all control bars
  via `fScenarioRestoreChrome()` (inline `display` + `hide` class + viewer
  buttons), since class-based hides beat inline restore.
* 3D style: JSmol style/spin/H/symbols are stored.
* 3D camera: `view3D.moveto` stores the verbatim JSmol `moveto`
  string captured via `Jmol.scriptWait(applet, "show moveto")`-only
  (S1 repair 2026-10-04: the `getPropertyAsString(applet, "moveto")`
  branch poisoned stored steps and is deleted). `null` means "use
  the data-file default" (`nameExamples[mol].moveto`, applied in
  `fLoadMol3D`). Capture with `rotate off`; apply
  after `load + center`, before `spt/init-3.spt`, then restore
  the `spin` flag. Validate prefix `moveto`, strict numeric grammar, strip newlines.
* Never persist transient handles: SVG nodes, JSmol objects,
  `myNumberingTimeout`, TTS voices.
  (Removed 2026-10-06: `externalLinks` reserved passthrough — not in this phase;
  legacy files carrying it load with it silently stripped.)

Visibility rules:

* `show.viewers` is the representation mode: 2D-only, 3D-only,
  or both. A hidden viewer is not rendered at all (skip
  `fLoadMol2D` / `fLoadMol3D`, `display:none`), reusing the
  scope of `fToggleViewer2D` and `fToggleViewer3D`.
* `show.viewerMaxHeight` (additive, v48; number px | `"full"` | `null`, default
  `null` = Auto) caps a **single visible** viewer's height. Auto caps it at
  the both-visible share (`fViewerHeights2D3D`), so hiding the other viewer
  never resizes the survivor; an explicit value (px clamped
  `VIEWER_MIN_H`–`VIEWER_MAX_H`, live 150–2000, silently sanitized; `"full"`
  fills the live viewport on whatever screen plays the step, resolved per
  screen and stored as the string, never as px; `warning`
  on non-empty invalid input) overrides. The author
  sets it in the Ρυθμίσεις panel (unchecked = Auto, checked = slider px with
  a fixed 150–1000px range, or the `Full` toggle for the viewport-relative
  height). Applied in playback
  too (via `fScenarioApplyViewerMaxHeight`), stashed/restored around
  Present like the other live settings. Both viewers share a min-height floor
  (`VIEWER_MIN_H`, live **150px** — owner-tuned down from 240; the CSS
  `.JmolContainer`/`#jsmeNomeclatureSVG` floor is driven by this constant via
  the `--viewerMinH` variable), so a long note scrolls the
  page instead of squashing them.
  The fit subtracts the visible `#scStepText` note card (offsetHeight +
  margins) too, so a two-viewer present step with a top note reserves room
  for it (re-fit from `fScenarioChrome` after the card is written). The
  v50 side layout skips that subtraction only while a left/right side
  rail is actually applied (the card is a fourth flex item beside the app,
  not above it); narrow-screen/top fallback still subtracts.
* `show.viewerBothHeight` (additive, v48; number px | `"full"` | `null`, default
  `null` = Auto) sets the **combined** 2D+3D height of the viewers when
  **two** are visible — each viewer takes half. Auto keeps the equal split
  (`fViewerHeights2D3D`); an explicit value (px clamped 300–1000; `"full"`
  fills the live viewport instead, resolved per playback screen; silently
  sanitized, `warning` on non-empty invalid input) **overrides** the split for
  both, so 300 → 150px each and 1000 → 500px each (the page scrolls if the total
  no longer fits; the `<430px` phone cap still trims). The author sets it in the
  Ρυθμίσεις panel (unchecked = Auto, checked = fixed 300–1000px slider, or the
  `Full` toggle, live re-fit on drag). Applied in playback too (via
  `fScenarioApplyViewerMaxHeight`), stashed/restored around Present like the
  other live settings; independent of the single-viewer cap (each governs its
  own visibility case). The viewport budget (`total` in `fViewerHeights2D3D`)
  subtracts the header, the `h1`, the visible `#creditsUs`, the top note card
  (unless a side rail is applied), and — while presenting — the fixed
  `#scenarioPlayBar`, so `Full` clears the title, the presentation navigation,
  and the footer on any playback screen.
* `show.controls.2D` toggles `#radio2DMode`
  (`Συνεπτυγμένος/Ανεπτυγμένος/Σκελετικός`, `Σύμβολα CHn`).
  Per-step drawer checkbox `2D controls` (default unchecked; disabled
  unless the step's 2D viewer is visible). On apply the bar visuals
  (mode radios, CHn box) mirror the step's stored values via
  `fScenarioSyncControlUi()`, not the live states. `Έγχρωμα Σύμβολα`
  (`#svgAtomColorCheck`) moved out of this bar into the Ρυθμίσεις panel
  (v48), merged with the `Χρωματισμός ατόμων 2D` atom/group radios.
* `show.controls.3D` toggles `#controls3D`:
  `Υδρογόνα C-H`, `#dropMenu` style, `Περιστροφή`. Irrelevant when that
  viewer is hidden. Per-step drawer checkbox `3D controls` (default
  unchecked; disabled unless the step's 3D viewer is visible). On apply
  the bar visuals (3D checkboxes, style dropdown label) mirror the step's
  stored values. `Σύμβολα ατόμων` (`#atomSymbolsCheck`) moved out of this
  bar into the Ρυθμίσεις panel as its own `Σύμβολα ατόμων 3D` row (v48).
* `show.save` toggles `#save2DBtn` / `#save3DBtn`
  independently of `controls`. Default `false`; there is no authoring
  checkbox for it, so in practice the save-image buttons now ride their
  viewer's `2D/3D ρυθμίσεις` checkbox (`show.controls`) — shown whenever
  the matching control bar is shown — with a stored `show.save` acting as
  an additional OR trigger (legacy files).
* `#viewerVisBtns`, `#viewerSettingsPanel` +
  `#viewerSettingsBtnDiv` are always hidden in playback; the left menu
  is hidden unless the step carries a menu subset (`show.menu`, see
  section 3). Captured values still land in the snapshot either way.
* Per-step menu subsets (`menuSubset: [...]`, molecule keys): the live pick
  at Save time (author ticks rows / whole tri-state groups in pick mode,
  or just clicks rows — selecting a molecule in pick mode also picks it,
  and unpicking the selected molecule deselects it). No Menu checkbox:
  the menu is derived — 2+ picks show the flat menu (the step molecule is
  auto-included with a warning), a single pick collapses to the step
  molecule (adopted with a toast when nothing is selected; selection wins
  over a stray pick), and validation drops unknown molecules with a
   warning. Legacy files migrate on import (stored `show.menu` ignored).
* Per-step menu grouping (`menuGroups: [...]`, Ταξινομήσεις Μένου drawer
  checkboxes per step row: `Μόρια` default-checked, `Χημικές Τάξεις`,
  `Ομόλογες Σειρές`; presentation-only, author menu unchanged):
  `molecules`/empty renders the flat list; a single classified mode groups
  the picked subset (collapsible headers, carbon-count order, local
  numbering); 2+ checked modes show a present grouping switcher (memory-only
  choice, default = molecules when checked). Rows stay browsable in all
  views; unknown values coerce out, legacy files default to flat
  (`scenarioVersion` stays 1). Classified groups start shut (headers mirror
  the app `.crossMenuLi`, open header + body take its `--baseColor`
  selected chrome/border); the group holding the selected molecule renders
  open. Headers run a main-app-identical accordion (open shuts the rest,
  explicit slideUp/slideDown, selection preserved); the switcher lays its
  radios in one column.
* Menu-only steps (`selectedMol: null`): a picked set of 2+ with no molecule
  selected still saves (title `"menu"`); presentation deselects first
  (empty viewers, no previous molecule lingering) and shows the flat pick
  menu. The naming hint line hides only when interaction is locked
  (`Name interact` off); when interaction is on it stays visible and
  reappears on free-browse selection (the browsed molecule's boxes are
   clickable with guidance). Every rebuild re-asserts the step's naming
   chrome (`fScenarioApplyNamingChrome`: gear/panel + voice stay hidden
   when their boxes are unchecked, while the `Ονομασία` title remains).
   With no molecule selected the component row shows the muted placeholder
   “Επιλέξτε μόριο για ανάλυση ονόματος”; the explain line also hides when
   zero boxes are actually visible. Accepted iff the subset is non-empty.
* `show.naming` / `show.rule` toggle the explanation and rule
  panels. `show.nameSettings` toggles the naming gear + panel and voice
  buttons (per-step drawer checkbox `Name controls`, default unchecked);
  the `Ονομασία` title remains visible either way. The shell (title +
  gear) renders on page load and with no molecule selected, showing the
  component-row placeholder;
  `show.nameClick` gates name-box interaction only (per-step drawer checkbox
  `Name interact`, default unchecked: locked boxes ignore mouse clicks via
  a `locked` class, but the stored `nameAnalysisMode` highlight +
  explanation always replay; the explain line hides only when locked with
  no stored highlight; absent in legacy files = allowed).
  `show.audio` toggles narration buttons. Playback never
  auto-plays TTS.
* Per-component visibility: `styleName.hidden` lists hidden comp ids
  (e.g. `["comp5"]`); hidden boxes render a dash on a `lightBlue` fill,
  ignore clicks, and are skipped by narration and stored-highlight replay
  (PNG shows them as displayed). Authors toggle boxes via the master
  eye-edit switch in `#nameSettingsPanel` (live-only, never stored) +
  per-box eye buttons; Save/Update captures the set. `show.nameEye`
  (per-step drawer checkbox `Ορατότητα συνθετικών`, default unchecked,
  molecule steps only; absent in legacy files = no toggles) seeds the
  master switch on step entry; while the naming settings gear is shown
  the master toggles the eyes live, otherwise eyes follow `show.nameEye`
  directly. `Update` refreshes `hidden` from the live view and preserves
  `nameEye`; Present stashes / Exit restores the author's live hidden set
  + edit mode. Eye-hiding the highlighted box also repaints the 2D SVG
  so its highlight vanishes at once.
* `title` is the step heading: in presentation it replaces the
  page `#pageTitle` (number pill `<span class="scStepNumberTitle">N.</span>`
  currently disabled — append commented out 2026-10-11, headings render
  title-only; span construction + pill CSS kept for revert); on exit the
  app title is
  restored. `note` is the educational paragraph in `#scStepText`
  directly below the title. `noteFormat: "text"` (default/legacy) keeps
  the escape-first subset (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<sup>`, `<sub>`,
  `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<small>`, `<big>`); `noteFormat: "html"`
  uses DOMPurify with a curated allowlist (paragraphs, lists, links,
  tables, figures, images, `note-*` classes, and rule-table components).
  Rich notes add UL/OL lists, per-block font size/alignment, image (file dialog
  with required alt and optional width/height), table, and rule-table helpers,
  plus an expand control that opens the modal editor. The inline drawer is a
  compact WYSIWYG editor with live writes; the modal has a WYSIWYG/HTML source
  toggle, DOM-selection formatting, sanitized paste, and staged Apply/Cancel
  with a dirty-close confirm. New notes default to HTML; legacy text notes
  render safely and upgrade on first edit. Presentation keeps the v50 top/left/right rails and
  has no separate wide/focus mode. Heading +
  text show automatically iff the step carries a title or note;
  clear both for a silent visual step (app title kept). Author
  mode always shows the app title and hides the text div (text is
  written in the drawer textarea).

## 3. Authoring UX

* Authoring mode (off by default): the vertical `Σενάρια` handle
  (✎ pencil, docked flush to the author bar's top-left corner, `40px`,
  first child, travels with the bar, highlighted while open),
  reveals the panel stack. Closing: handle toggle, ✕ in the title
  bar, or ESC (never while typing or presenting); hiding disengages
  pick mode but keeps picks and steps. The Pick checkbox appears only
  while authoring. Presentation hides the whole unit. The pin button
  (title row, v48) docks the bar at the right edge of `#pageContainer`,
  spanning its full height; opening slides the docked bar in from the right
  edge via the Web Animations API (`fScenarioSlideBar`, since docking reparents
  the bar and a CSS transition can't see the state change), with `.open` still
  the visibility/state authority and reduced-motion/no-WAAPI falling back to an
  instant change; `#mainAppContainer` (exactly
  the three columns)
  is the horizontal scroller and the title + footer yield a 480px band,
  so name settings stay reachable while authoring
  (viewer widths frozen from a pre-dock read, applets untouched). Authoring
  opens with the bar docked: the pin default is on and remembered
  session-scoped (`pinPref`, live-only, never stored in steps); ✕/ESC and
  Present entry unpin, but the choice is re-applied when authoring reopens via
  the tab and on Present → Exit (`fScenarioApplyPinPref` is authoring-only, so
  presentation always hides the bar; deep-link presents, authoring off, exit
  with no bar/pin; a session unpin is remembered until a reload restores the
  pinned default).
* Global shell (`#scenarioAuthorBar`): single merged header row (`#scenarioPlayBarTitle`: `+ New` + `Import` left, title center, `✕` (`closePanel` arrow icon) in-flow right; `#scenarioGlobalBar` retired 2026-10-11, ids preserved). `+ New` makes an empty scenario
  card (locks with a toast while `maxEmptyScenarios = 3` empties exist);
  `Import` (each import adds a card, always lands untouched). Single column,
  panels scroll under the `85vh` cap, never shrink. One empty card is
  always kept: a panel's Delete locks when it is the last remaining card
  and empty (a sole filled card keeps delete-then-autocreate); every
  scenario Delete is confirm-guarded (icon `deleteStep`, modal names
  the scenario — `fScenarioConfirm`).
* Scenario cards (`.scenarioPanel[data-scenario-id]`, explicit active
  card): per-card title rename, step count, delete (`deleteStep`
  icon, confirm-guarded); the optional `Author:` row (`.scenarioMeta` /
  `.scenarioAuthor`, v52) sits under the header and blank stores `"Unknown"`;
  button panel
  (`Add step`, `Steps`, `Export`, `Play ▶` — no Import; Play always
  starts at step 1); in-flow
  drawer (down/up via `.open`, accordion: one open at a time,
  drawer follows the active card — Steps button or bar-gap click
  toggles it; Add opens-only, Export/Play leave the panel untouched;
  Add also pins the drawer to the new last row). The open card and its
  scroll position survive closing/reopening the bar and Play → Exit: the
  drawer is hidden by CSS while the bar is away, and Exit scrolls it back
  to the presented step. The Steps button (or a bar-gap click) still
  closes it deliberately.
* Step rows: number + type badge (`molecule`/`menu`, key in tooltip)
  stacked in `.scStepNumberWrap`, step title (`Τίτλος βήματος` label
  above the field, defaults to the live Greek IUPAC name at Save —
  key fallback, `"menu"` for menu-only), per-step educational text
  (`note` rich editor with formatting toolbar: `B I sup sub`, clear, UL/OL
  lists, per-block font-size dropdown (`14/18/22/26`), left/center/right
  alignment dropdown (WYSIWYG only), image file dialog/table and icon-only
  rule-table inserts, expand-to-dialog, 1↔2 column toggle icon; the old
  whole-text `Size (px)` / `Width (px)` inputs are removed, so
  `styleText.fontSizePx` is only a legacy base and `styleText.textWidthPx` is
  ignored; 1↔2 column toggle `styleText.columns` (default 1; lists never split
  via `break-inside`, small screens collapse to 1); `Θέση: Πάνω / Αριστερά /
  Δεξιά` icon dropdown `styleText.position` (`"left"`/`"right"`, or null = top;
  v50); `<small>`/`<big>` still render in saved notes but are not inserted),
  per-step chrome
   checkboxes (`2D controls`, `3D controls`, `Name controls`,
   `Name interact`, `Ορατότητα συνθετικών`, plus `Ταξινομήσεις Μένου` (`Μόρια` default-checked,
  `Χημικές Τάξεις`, `Ομόλογες Σειρές` — presentation-only menu views,
  shown only on menu-carrying steps, all-off valid → flat fallback;
  see §2) — see §2; no `Text`/`Menu`: text is automatic, menu
   is derived), `Go` (preview/apply the step in authoring — also activates
   the row's card first, then aligns the live pick to the step via
   `fScenarioGoAlignPick` (subset steps restore picks + pick mode on,
   menu-less molecule steps clear silently; unknown keys filtered) and the
   viewer chrome to the step's viewers via `fScenarioRestoreChrome`, the
   same helper Exit uses — panes + `[2D][3D]` actives + control bars follow
   the step; present navigation never touches picks), `▶` Present
   (enters presentation at this step via the same
   `fScenarioPresentBegin(scenId, idx)` used by card Play, with the row's
   0-based index; card Play omits it and starts at step 1), `Update`
  (rewrite the step's stored view snapshot from the current live view:
  Go → tweak molecule, 2D/3D modes + styles, naming clicks/toggles,
   camera, pick → Update; preserves `title`/`note` + the 4 chrome
   checkboxes + `show.nameEye` + `menuGroups` + `styleText` (legacy size, parsed width, columns, position), refreshes everything visual incl. `nameAnalysisMode`,
   `styleName.hidden` (from the live eye toggles),
   `menuSubset`/`show.menu`/`show.viewers`; toasts kind/subset changes),
  `⧉` duplicate (deep-clone after, title + ` (αντίγραφο)`),
   reorder up/down, delete (`deleteStep` icon, pinned to the row's
   top-right corner and transparent until hover, red danger hover,
   confirm-guarded), jump-to; step numbers
  auto-renumber.
   Headers lead with a positional counter (`S1`, `S2`, …); empty
   scenarios (0 steps) flag `.is-empty` on card, count, and Steps button,
   disable Steps/Export/Play (`disabled`, dimmed, no hover or text change —
   Steps/Play dark `baseColor`, Export light `bgColor`; Add step
   stays live, Delete stays live except on the last remaining empty card,
   first save re-enables), and never drop the drawer
   (the clicked card still activates, other drawers still collapse).
   The Steps button carries the dark `baseColor` chrome.
* 3D camera: `moveto` is captured at Save time (no per-step UI while
  JSmol `moveto` is broken; returns with the fix).
* `fCaptureSnapshot()` reads the live state described above.

## 4. Playback UX + URL shape (frozen)

* Canonical URL:
  `mulermoc-nom-52.html?scenario=scenarios/<name>.json&present=1#step=3`
* `?scenario=path.json`: which file. v1 allows same-origin
  `scenarios/*.json` only (reject `..`, non-`.json`,
  cross-origin). Fetched over `http(s)`; `file://` users must
  use the Import button instead (`fetch()` of local files is
  blocked by the browser).
* `?present=1`: playback chrome (hide menu, viewer
  buttons/settings, apply `show.*`). Absent = author preview
  with chrome and step list visible.
* `#step=N`: 1-based step in the hash so Prev/Next can use
  `history.replaceState` without a full reload (JSME/JSmol init
  is expensive). Missing/invalid/clamped to 1/last with notice.
* `Play ▶` on a scenario card always starts at step 1. Each step row's
  `▶` starts presentation at that step instead; both enter the same player
  and write `#step=N`. Exit returns to authoring with the card's drawer
  (if open) scrolled to the step that was on stage.
* Fixed present bar (`#scenarioPlayBar`): full left shows the scenario identity
  (`#scScenarioId` ← `title · author`, author via `fScenarioValidAuthor`;
  ellipsis-truncated with the full string in the hover title, author hidden
  under 700px), center keeps the `Prev [3/8] Next` step counter, right keeps
  `Exit ✕`. Keyboard: `←`/`→`
  walk steps (clamped, no wrap), `ESC` exits. Keys ignore modifiers
  and typing focus; JSmol arrow-rotate under applet focus is a known
  overlap (mouse-drag is the normal rotate path).
* Each step sets the page heading (`#pageTitle` ← `N. title`)
  and the educational text div below it (`#scStepText` ← `note`,
  simple-HTML subset), automatically iff the step carries a title or
  note — otherwise the app title is kept and nothing shows. The
  fixed play bar keeps the step counter plus the scenario identity
  (`#scScenarioId`); the old per-step title/note pill nodes are retired.
* v50 text position (live): default `styleText.position: null` keeps the top
  card. `"left"`/`"right"` move the note into a sticky, internally scrolling
  `clamp(300px, 24vw, 420px)` rail beside the app at ≥1200px, as the first/last
  fourth flex item in `#mainAppContainer > .mainApp3Columns` (8px row gap;
  page max width `calc(1600px + rail + 8px)`). Below 1200px CSS falls back to
  the top card before `#mainAppContainer`. In presentation the top card spans
  the union of the visible menu/viewer/analysis columns (menu only when the
  step shows it), measured by JS into `--scStepTextFitWidth` /
  `--scStepTextFitLeft`, clamped to `#authorLayout`, with a full-width fallback
  and the 1600px cap. The rail always renders one column and fits its content
  up to a max-height cap (`align-self:flex-start`, `height:auto` on a
  full-height `authorLayout > mainAppContainer > mainApp3Columns` chain);
  long rails internal-scroll capped 20px above `#creditsUs` and never push
  the footer down. JS sets the inline max-height to the larger of the tallest
  visible app column and the scroll-invariant available space
  (`window.innerHeight` minus rail document-top minus footer height minus a
  20px gap — live viewport rects would ratchet, growing but never shrinking
  while the page scrolls). `textWidthPx` is ignored in v52. Switching
  top↔side refits viewers;
  `fViewerHeights2D3D` skips the note-height subtraction only while a side rail
  is actually applied.
* `#menuCol` is hidden wholesale in presentation so the remaining
  columns center on the page; exit restores it. Exception: a step with
  `show.menu` shows its `menuSubset` with local
  1..N numbering (never the dataset-global counter) — flat list by default,
  single-grouped collapsible view for one classified `menuGroups` mode, or
  a present grouping switcher for 2+ modes (see §2); no pick checkboxes;
  rows stay clickable for free
  browsing. `#pageContainer.presenting` scopes present-only CSS (flipped
  on every step apply + Exit; first override: taller `.menuListContainer`,
  350px vs the 150px author default). Exit rebuilds the pristine author menu instead.
* Menu forced shut in playback unless the step carries 2+ picks;
  panels and control bars follow `show.*`.
* Student self-learning uses the same playback without a teacher.
* Import-button flow is the primary v1 path (works offline from
  USB); `?scenario=` links are for hosted/classroom-server use
  and future Drupal.

## 5. File format + validation + storage decision

* v1 storage: memory-only plus file (decision A). Steps live in
  a JS variable; `Export .json` downloads a Blob (same pattern
  as `fSave2DPng`), `Import .json` reads via file input. Reload
  without export loses unsaved steps by design.
  Export (v52) first tries the browser Save window
  (`showSaveFilePicker`, Chromium secure origins) so the author can choose
  folder + filename (suggested name = sanitized title + `.scenario.json`,
  reserved characters → `_`); cancelling is silent and any picker failure,
  Firefox/Safari, or an insecure origin falls back to the original
  `<a download>` Blob click.
* Follow-up (not v1): `localStorage` scratch draft
  (`mulermoc.scenario.draft.v1`) with resume/discard UI for
  crash-safe authoring.
* Unknown `selectedMol` renders a skipped-step notice.
* Missing 2D representation falls back via the existing
  `fUpdateDiagr2DButton` logic (condensed > expanded > skeletal).
* Corrupt JSON is rejected with a readable error; valid prefix
  steps are never half-applied.
* Version policy (`validateScenario()`, `SUPPORTED_VERSION = 1`):
  missing `scenarioVersion` = v0 legacy, best-effort apply with
  "legacy file" warning; `> 1` = refuse ("needs a newer app");
  `== 1` = apply; `< 1` = in-memory `migrateScenario()`
  filling defaults (`moveto: null`,
  `show.save/audio: false`) without overwriting the
  file — the user Exports to upgrade. Removed fields (`externalLinks`,
  `show.infoHost`) are stripped silently. Bump `scenarioVersion`
  only on breaking schema changes; additive optional fields use
  defaults and need no bump.

## 6. molInfo / PubChem removal (done 2026-10-06 — not in this phase)

Removed from the v43 set (carried through v44 into v45): `molInfoBtn` / `molInfoPanel` dead code
(`molInfoEnabled = false`) in `js/mulermoc-nom-molview-43.js`
(`fToggleMolInfo`, `svgInfo`, panel/button builders) + molInfo CSS in
`css/jsme-nick-43.css` + `molInfoPanelSlot` host + `externalLinks` /
`show.infoHost` in `js/mulermoc-nom-scenario-43.js` (capture/defaults
stripped; legacy files load with them silently ignored, no version bump).
`docs/PUBCHEM_HYBRID_PLAN.md` deleted.

Kept untouched: v42 copies (`molview-42.js`, `jsme-nick-42.css` — frozen),
`archive/**` (museum), `mols/**/*.sdf` (`PUBCHEM_*` source-data tags).

* Legacy `#molInfo` in `functional-groups.html:80` is a
  different page and stays untouched (now in `archive/html/`).

## 7. v1 build status (v43 done, v44 released, v52 current)

Done in v43 (`mulermoc-nom-43.html`, last suffixed copy; carried through v44 into v45 unchanged unless noted in `CHANGELOG.md [v44]`):

1. ✅ `js/mulermoc-nom-scenario-43.js`:
   capture / validate / apply / export / import.
2. ✅ `mulermoc-nom-43.html`: includes the scenario module + `css/mulermoc-nom-scenario-43.css`
   (toolbar, playback bar, import input are injected at
   runtime; all scenario chrome formats live in the stylesheet, not in JS).
3. ✅ Apply path through `fSelectMol -> fShowNameAnalysis ->
   fExplainNameComp -> fShowRule`; chrome hidden in playback.
4. ✅ `molInfo`/PubChem placeholders removed from v43 (see section 6).
5. Browser tests: save/present/navigate/exit, export/import
   round-trip, corrupt/missing-molecule imports, hidden-chrome
   assertions (manual click-through pending).
6. ✅ CHANGELOG v43 entry (`index.html` → 43 in repo3 only).

Remaining: v52 is live (`index.html` → 52 — unified inline/modal rich note editor with WYSIWYG + HTML source, lazy legacy-text upgrade, staged Apply/Cancel and dirty-close confirm; safe rich HTML notes, rule-table components, compact icon toolbar, 136 molecules, and a Snap-free native `MuSVG` 2D overlay; default preload `scenarios/Αλκάνια-Αιθάνιο-τεστ.scenario.json`; see `CHANGELOG.md [v52]`). It retains the v51 rich notes, the v50 per-step presentation text position (top/left/right fourth-column sticky rail) + persistent naming shell, and the v49 MSc-student import (see `CHANGELOG.md [v51]`/`[v50]`/`[v49]`); `*51*`–`*44*` runnable at root; scenario exports still write `"app": "mulermoc-nom-44"` (informational) and import accepts legacy files incl. `diagramatic` mode2D, coerced. Then quizzes/games on the
same reuse contract. The stepper's main-chain pool index is captured per step (`chainIdx`, v47 additive) and re-asserted on apply; only the transient EXPLORE walk UI position is not step state.

## 8. Open questions for development (moveto timing closed 2026-10-04)

* ~~Where the PubChem host panel should live long-term.~~ (removed 2026-10-06 — not in this phase; plan file deleted)
* ~~JSmol `moveto` timing on async `load`~~ — **closed by S1–S4 repair:**
  S1 capture is `scriptWait("show moveto")`-only (the `getPropertyAsString`
  branch poisoned stored steps and is deleted) with a strict numeric grammar
  + import-time quarantine (`moveto: null` + warning); S2 gates the per-step
  camera (+400ms, per-step token) and the name-box click (on
  `fFetchAndParse3D` completion via `fScenarioOn3DParsed`, 2s fallback) so the
  `fLoadMol3D` load batch wins; S3 waits for `jmol_isReady`
  (`window.JSmolReadyFlag`, ~12s fallback) on `?scenario&present` deep links
  and normalizes the legacy `" compSecondSub*"` mode keys. Capture and curate
  with `rotate off`.
* v42 backport policy (repo2): frozen — emergency hotfixes only,
  never push feature work there (see `README.md` two-repos table).

Many issues will surface during development; adjust there.

## 9. LEARN v1.1 — stored library (2026-10-03)

LEARN is layer 1 of the twofold+1 vision (see `README.md`, `docs/LAYERS-PLAN.md`). v50 provides the player (`*49*`–`*44*` runnable at root, v43 frozen at tag `v43`); v1.1 adds the library:

* **Stored scenarios** under `scenarios/*.json` (same-origin, validated v1 schema), listed by Drupal; URL shape unchanged (`?scenario=scenarios/<name>.json&present=1#step=N`); Import remains the offline/`file://` path.
* **First library (P3):** 3–5 scenarios (alkanes → alcohols → ethers → esters); each step keeps `selectedMol + show.*`; exit forces full chrome restore (menu `menu-open` + viewers/bars per the exit step — a no-3D exit leaves 3D hidden; settings panels + save buttons always come back).
* **Per-step menu subsets (EXPLORE-lite enforcement):** steps may carry a browsable `menuSubset` (tri-state group pick in authoring; menu derived — 2+ picks show it, single pick collapses to the step molecule); a scenario can walk students through an expanding universe (3 alkanes → +alcohols → +ether) instead of the full 73-molecule menu.
* **Two-level `note` convention:** `note` carries the teacher narrative; authoring guidance is EPAL-simple first line(s) / Lyceum-full extension (P3 authors, P5 uses for EPAL-vs-Lyceum comparison). Schema unchanged — convention only.
* **`moveto` curation:** capture with `rotate off`; prefer curated per-step cameras for the library over ad-hoc capture.
* **Authoring docs:** Save → Export → Present → Exit flow (Exit restores menu + exit-step viewers + all bars/panels; in-memory steps kept). `Go` previews align picks + viewer chrome to the step, so Go → tweak → Update round-trips keep the menu.
* **Default preload:** authoring boots with S1 = `scenarios/Αλκάνια-Αιθάνιο-τεστ.scenario.json` (fetched + validated; `?scenario=` deep links skip it, `file://` falls back to one empty card) and S2 = empty `untitled-scenario`, S1 active. The previous `scenarios/Αλκάνια-Αιθάνιο.scenario.json` is retained for explicit deep links but is no longer preloaded.

## 10. Future states (2026-10-09, docs-only, no code change)

* Current states: default (`!authoring && !present`), authoring (`authoring && !present`), presentation (`present == true`, wins over authoring; `showBar = authoring && !present`; `#pageContainer.presenting` is the CSS hook).
* Agreed direction: derived `fScenarioGetState()` getter as single authority; booleans stay as storage. No quiz planning now — quiz question as step + `itemType`/prompt/feedback reuse left open for PRACTICE/PLAY.
